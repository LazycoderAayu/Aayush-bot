# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We, as members, contributors, and maintainers of the **Aayush.bot** project, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
* Using welcoming and inclusive language.
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
* Focusing on what is best for the community.
* Showing empathy towards other community members.

**Note on Bot Behavior:** While this project involves developing a sarcastic AI, we distinguish between "creative AI characterization" and "human-to-human interaction." Rudeness directed at contributors is strictly prohibited.

## Enforcement
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.
