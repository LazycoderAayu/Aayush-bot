# 🗺️ Aayush.bot Project Roadmap

This document outlines the planned path for **Aayush.bot**. Our goal is to create the most engaging (and hilariously sarcastic) AI interface using the latest web technologies.

## 🟢 Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- [x] Migration to **React 19** and **Vite 6**.
- [x] Integration with **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro**.
- [x] Core UI components with **Tailwind CSS**.
- [x] Basic Markdown support for bot responses.

## 🟡 Phase 2: Enhanced Intelligence (Q2 2026)
- [ ] **Contextual Memory:** Implementing local storage or a database to remember previous roasts.
- [ ] **System Prompt Versioning:** Creating a toggle for "Sarcastic Mode" vs. "Formal Mode."
- [ ] **Multi-Model Support:** Allowing users to switch between Gemini Flash (speed) and Pro (logic).
- [ ] **Image Input:** Enabling Gemini's vision capabilities so the bot can roast your screenshots.

## 🟠 Phase 3: Ecosystem & Reach (Q3 2026)
- [ ] **Voice Integration:** Adding Web Speech API so the bot can literally talk back.
- [ ] **Discord/Telegram Bot:** Exporting the Aayush.bot logic to chat platforms.
- [ ] **Custom Themes:** Allowing users to customize the "Roast Room" aesthetic.

## 🔴 Phase 4: Advanced Features (Future)
- [ ] **RAG Implementation:** Allowing the bot to "read" your local documents before critiquing them.
- [ ] **Plugin System:** Letting community members write their own "personality modules."
